# DataTrap
This project is a Android apllication designed to support data gathering in fieldwork. All of its parts were made according to the specifications of the research team at University of Constantine the Philosopher in Nitra.

Further documentation can be found in my masters degree thesis at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnUAVlmukBfhaf0Phlfy04Fl1deqSX-U/view?usp=sharing

Development of this project is still in progress therefore further UI, functionality and code reformating will be added or changed.
