# DataTrap
This project is a Android apllication designed to support data gathering in fieldwork. All of its parts were made according to the specifications of the research team at University of Constantine the Philosopher in Nitra.

Further documentation can be found in my masters degree thesis in chapter 4 which can be found under this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnUAVlmukBfhaf0Phlfy04Fl1deqSX-U/view?usp=sharing

Development of this project is still in progress therefore further UI, functionality and code reformating will be added or changed. The development was rushed by the research team therefore these are some of the next augmentations to the code and the application itself:
- restructuring code by features
- applying clean code architecture using SOLID principles
- adding use cases
- migrating UI from XML files to Jetpack Compose
- for network communication with university server will be applied the Retrofit library
